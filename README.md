# Desing Pattern - Abstract Factory Project

In This project I´ll implement a Desing Pattern concept that is called **Abstract Factory Project**]

The Abstract Factory interface bellow us to  create family of objects related without declare ours classes 
- Its provide a way to create object families related without declare solid classes
--- The Abstract Factory Solution
-- Encapsulating object creation: Delegates the creation of objects to factory classes
-- Providing consistency: Ensures that objects belong to a singles family 

-- challenge: The factory need to create buttons, inputs, modals and texts
but each plataform has different implementations
